## SEMESTER ASSIGNMENT
</div>

**Assignment Homework-**
1. For a given matrix, Mat[N x N], write a program to find
a) the rank of the given matrix
b) the highest eigen value of the matrix 
c) the determinant of the matrix
d) the transpose of the matrix

2. For a given matrix Mat[N x N], decompose it into two matrices MatL[N x N] and MatU[N x N], where MatL and MatU are lower and upper triangular matrices, such that Mat=MatL*MatU. Note: Lower triangular matrices are matrices, where the upper triangular elements above the diagonal of the matrix are 0.

3. For two given matrices Mat1[N x N] and Mat2[M x M], where M<<N , find if Mat2 is a subset of Mat1. 
Note: A matrix Matl is a subset of another matrix Mat2 if the elements of Mat1 exists in Mat2 

4. Design an algorithm to solve the Travelling Salesman problem. Take the datasets from
a) https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/datasets/tsp/tsp.html 
b) https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/data/index.html

5. From the dataset of Assignment 4, find the minimum spanning tree of the given graph.

6. The diameter of a tree is the maximum length of a path between two nodes. Given a undirected graph, find the diameter of the graph.

7. Write a program to solve the "Rat-in-a-Maze" problem for various dimensions of the maze. How do you propose to present the output for a large maze?

8. Take an arbitrary matrix of positive integers, say, 128x128. Also take integer matrices of size 3x3 and 5x5. Find out an output matrix of size 128x128 by multiplying the samll matrix with the corresponding submatrix of the large matrix with the center of the small matrix palced at the individual positions within the large matrix. Explain how you will handle the boundary values.

9. Implement signed 22x15 multiplier using 8x8 signed multiplier and adder logic.

10. Take two arbitrary matrices positive integers, say, 128x128. Multiply both of them by implementing both of them as row-major matrices.

11. Write a program implementing the Knuth-Morris-Pratt pattern matching algorithm.
